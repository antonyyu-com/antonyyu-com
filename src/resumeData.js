    "aboutme":"I am a user-obsessed, technical, and operationally minded leader with 10 years of experience in tech and program operations. Having built teams globally in 16 countries, I am no stranger to working in fast-paced, hybrid, and global conditions. I'm passionate about engineering simple solutions to complex problems. During my experiences at Riot Games and Tencent, I held roles in leadership, program operations, and organizational transformation, which honed my strengths in change management, mentorship, and delivery operations leading me to my adventure at Huckleberry as VP Operations. A common thread throughout my career is my ability to enthusiastically coach and mentor my colleagues to grow their self confidence and regularly challenge convention. I extended this passion by becoming a full stack software engineer - I am looking to use my relationship building skills to create products and experiences that are at the intersection of building community and advancements in technology.",
